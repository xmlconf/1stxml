	              			<h2>Forecasting the Performance of Tunnel Boring Machines Using Gaussian Processes</h2>
	              			<p>There is a vast network of buried infrastructure and services in the UK comprising water, sewer, gas and electricity which extends to well over 1.5 million km. Microtunnelling is an increasingly popular means of constructing these underground utilities compared to traditional ‘open cut’. The proliferation of data collected by tunnel boring machines poses a significant opportunity to present site engineers with meaningful information upon which to make informed and timely decisions. This talk will explore the potential for Gaussian Processes (GPs) to forecast the performance of a tunnel boring machine during microtunnelling and form part of an early warning system to avoid adverse responses on site. The GP forecasts will also be appraised through comparisons to existing empirical models currently used by industry as well as monitored data from two live UK construction sites.</p>

	              			<p>Communication devices and connectivity are increasingly ubiquitous,
contributing to a rapidly-expanding infrastructure. This development promises to tackle some of the most challenging issues facing society today - how healthcare is delivered to an aging and expanding population. Each year, millions of people worldwide suffer
from chronic long-term diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney malfunction, with limited access to appropriate treatment. Machine learning plays a key role in determining how effective healthcare will be delivered to future generations. Reliable
continuous tracking of patient health can provide accurate early warning of health deterioration. “Big data” (e.g.: electronic health records and data from wearable devices for monitoring chronic diseases and well-being) are now being collected, which cover
the entirety of patient care, throughout the life of a patient. It is therefore necessary to develop novel machine learning methods to exploit the contents of these large complex datasets by performing robust, automated inference at very large scale.</p>

	              			<h2>Machine Learning to detect fetal compromise during labour and delivery</h2>
	              			<p>The gold standard to assess whether a baby is at risk of oxygen starvation during childbirth, is monitoring continuously the fetal heart rate with cardiotocography (CTG), comprising two time series: fetal heart rate and contraction strength. The goal of monitoring is to identify babies that could benefit from an emergency operative delivery (e.g., Cesarean section), in order to prevent death or permanent brain injury. The long, dynamic and complex CTG patterns are poorly understood and known to have high false positive and false negative rates. Visual interpretation by clinicians is challenging and reliable accurate fetal monitoring in labour remains an enormous unmet medical need.

Our team has acquired a uniquely large and detailed cohort of routinely collected data during labour at Oxford (all monitored births between Apr’93 and Dec’18). We have already developed a basic computerized data-driven prototype for CTG evaluation: OxSys 1.5 (Georgieva at al. 2017 “Computerized data-driven interpretation of the intrapartum cadiotocogram: a cohort study”. Acta Obstet Gynecol Scand96(7)). It works comparable to CTG evaluation by doctors in clinical practice but is based only on a few clinical and CTG features and further improvements are needed. The size of our database confers scope for substantial improvement of OxSys and we are working towards developing a much more sophisticated OxSys 2.0.

In this talk I will present our work on the first application of deep learning for the analysis of the CTG. I will demonstrate that Multimodal Convolutional Neural Networks hold potential for the prediction the newborns with compromise at birth and further work is warranted. Furthermore, I will discuss why our deep learning models are currently not suitable for the detection of certain severe fetal injuries that are part of a heterogeneous, small, and poorly understood group. 

We suggest that the most promising way forward are hybrid approaches to CTG interpretation in labour, in which different diagnostic models can estimate the risk for different types of fetal compromise, incorporating clinical knowledge with data-driven analyses.</p>
